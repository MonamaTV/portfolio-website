const bio = `<p>
I am a solution-driven person who seeks environments that challenge me
to help widen my experience and grow on both personal and professional
levels. My key strengths are my abilities to solve problems and
perform very well under pressure, including carrying out instructions.
I enjoy working within environments that allow collaborative efforts â€“
you get to learn a lot from people with different experience and skill
sets.
</p>
<br />
<p>
On the technical side, I have practical web development exposure as I
have worked with a couple of web technologies such as the MERN stack,
TypeScript, Firebase and more. Most importantly, a desire to always
want to learn more is one of my attributes.
